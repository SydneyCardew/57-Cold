## INTRODUCTION

This software is designed to run the small-scale 
LRP Game '57 Cold'. It calculates the outcome of player 
actions and runs a simplified game world simulation 
designed to produce both a certain degree of depth and fairness to the
outcomes of the actions of the players. Aspects of its
design mirror the fictional 'National Management Computer',
used by the players to help run the affairs of state.

### 57 Cold

57 Cold is set during an alternative version of the early
cold war. The players take on the roles of members of the
*National Management Committee*, a fictional UK government
body with extraordinary powers. The structure of the 
committee is intentionally designed to create intense
political intrigue among the players as they attempt to
navigate the country through a deteriorating international
and domestic situation.

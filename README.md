## INTRODUCTION

This software is designed to run the small-scale 
LRP Game '57 Cold'. It calculates the outcome of player 
actions and runs a simplified game world simulation 
designed to produce both a certain degree of depth and fairness to the
outcomes of the actions of the players. Aspects of its
design mirror the fictional 'National Management Computer',
used by the players to help run the affairs of state.

### 57 Cold

57 Cold is set during an alternative version of the early
cold war. The players take on the roles of members of the
*National Management Committee*, a fictional UK government
body with extraordinary powers. The structure of the 
committee is intentionally designed to create intense
political intrigue among the players as they attempt to
navigate the country through a deteriorating international
and domestic situation.

A WORD FROM THE DIRECTOR

Dear Technician,
    Congratulations! You have managed to
wangle your way  into one  of  the  most 
exciting jobs in the whole British civil
service, if  you  can  believe that! The
NMC (affectionately  nick-named 'NELLIE'
by the boffins  here  at J Section) is a
totally new development in the burgeoni-
ng  field  of  cybernetics.  
    Every  day, across Britain and thro-
ughout the commonwealth (and beyond!), 
hundreds of securely encrypted  teletype
style messages containing coded informa-
tion about  everything  from  industrial 
production figures, to weather  reports, 
to troop movements, to opinion polls and 
much more wing their way at the speed of 
light to  a top  secret facility  buried 
under  the  rolling Sussex  hills. There  
they are collated, tabulated and  loaded 
onto  miles of  indestructible  magnetic  
tape that  worms its way through a  vast 
electronic brain, capable of  performing  
many  thousands  of  fiendishly  complex  
equations flawlessly every second, using  
the modern miracle of transistors.  
    Soon, every government office, whet-
her  it  be in  Whitehall  or Wakefield, 
will have installed a 'terminal' outfit,
(just like the  one  you are sitting  in 
front of now!), capable of sending quer-
ies and  commands to the NMC 'Mainframe'
and displaying the results near instant-
aneously on a  cathode  ray tube device.
The  reports,  projections,  simulations
and other data thus  made available will
put government  on a solidly  scientific
basis, leading to a bold new era of pro-
sperity and the inevitable ascendency of
British interests over the sinister for-
ces of not only international communism,  
but also our erstwhile American allies!
    Exciting times are ahead, and you h-
ave found  yourself right in the middle!
Think of the machine  before you as  the
'wheelhouse' of the ship of state. Treat
it with the respect it deserves,  and do 
not *under any circumstances* place cups
or mugs containing  hot  beverages on or
near the machine! 
    - L. Smith, 
    NMC Project Director,
    Ministry of Development (J Section)
